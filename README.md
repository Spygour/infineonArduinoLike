These are some drivers regarding the use of infineon tc275 mainly for IOT projects.
Right now I am working with the Kalman filter of MPU6050 and the usage of ENC module (Ethernet Library).
Anyone who is interested feel free to reach me for any help.
The drivers will be updated slowly in order to be more understandable from every user.
NOTE: The Libraries used were Infineon's ILLD libraries. Usage only for evaluation. I do not own anything from the ILLD libraries.
