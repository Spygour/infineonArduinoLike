These are some drivers regarding the use of infineon tc275 mainly for IOT projects.
Right now I am working with the Kalman filter of MPU6050 and the usage of ENC module (Ethernet Library layers 1,2,3,4,5 so far).
Anyone who is interested feel free to reach me for any help.
The drivers will be updated slowly in order to be more understandable from every user.
NOTE: In order to use the following libraries you need the ILLD libraries that are provided by infineon. ILLD functions are used as interfaces for my projects. Projects are for evaluation reasons only. 
I do not own anything regarding the ILLD libraries (functions starting with Ifx are owned by infineon).
